## Getting Started

To start your React Native Expo app, you'll need to use the Expo CLI. Here are the steps to start your app using Expo:

1. **Ensure Expo CLI is Installed**:
   First, make sure you have Expo CLI installed globally on your machine. If not, you can install it using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory of your Match & Date React Native Expo app:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/Match-and-Date
   ```

3. **Start the Expo Development Server**:
   Run the following command to start the Expo development server:

   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

4. **Run the App on an Emulator or Device**:
   - If you have an Android or iOS emulator running, you can press `a` (for Android) or `i` (for iOS) in the terminal to launch the app on the respective emulator.
   - If you want to run the app on a physical device, you can scan the QR code displayed in the terminal using the Expo app on your device. Make sure your device is connected to the same network as your development machine.

   Expo will build the app and open it in the Expo client on your emulator or device. You can now interact with and test your Match & Date app.
